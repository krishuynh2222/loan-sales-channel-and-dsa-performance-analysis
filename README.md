# üìä Loan Sales & DSA Performance Report | 2023 

This project is a simulated version of a real-world reporting project originally developed for Shinhan Finance. All data has been modified and anonymized to protect business confidentiality. The structure, analysis logic, and reporting approach reflect realistic practices in the financial industry.

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of loan disbursement performance by Sales Channel and DSA (Direct Sales Agents) for a financial institution. The process includes data cleaning and performance analysis using SQL, followed by the development of interactive Tableau dashboards to monitor loan sales, channel contribution, and DSA performance.
